# Resume Generator Project Rules

## Data Integrity
- **Never invent or fabricate resume data**. If additional data is needed to fulfill a feature or improve ATS score, ask the user for it explicitly.
- All resume content must come from the user or the existing `resume-data.ts` file.

## Layout Constraints
- **The resume must always fit within a single A4 page** (210mm × 297mm).
- When adjusting content or layout, ensure nothing overflows the A4 boundaries.
- Balance font sizes and spacing to maximize readability while fitting all content.

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript types (not interfaces) for all type definitions.
- Type React component props inline within the function signature.
- Use named exports for React functional components.
- Avoid comments in code - code should be self-explanatory.
- Extract components to kebab-case `.tsx` files in a `components` folder at the same level.
- Do not import React explicitly (not needed in modern React).
